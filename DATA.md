# EO-NeRF Data

Description of the data used in "Multi-date Earth Observation NeRF: The Detail Is in the Shadows", presented at the CVPR 2023 EarthVision Workshop.

Any scientific publication using the data shall cite the EO-NeRF paper and the rest of publications mentioned in this README.

The available data comprises 3 sets: **(1) JAX_RGB**, **(2) JAX_NEW** and **(3) IARPA**. 7 different areas of interest are covered.

JAX_RGB was originally used in Sat-NeRF (MarÃ­ et al., 2022). EO-NeRF incorporated JAX_NEW and IARPA.


### (1) JAX_RGB set

- **Image dir:** `DFC2019/Track3-RGB-crops` -> Contains uint8 RGB images cropped from the DFC2019 preprocessed data.
- **JSON dir:** `SatNeRF/root_dir/crops_rpcs_ba_v2` -> Contains the satellite images metadata (geographic location, RPC models, sun position).
- **GT dir:** `Datasets/DFC2019/Track3-Truth` -> Contains ground-truth surface models (DSM) and segmentation masks (CLS) from the DFC2019 data.

### (2) JAX_NEW set

- **Image dir:** `DFC2019/Track3-NEW-crops` -> Contains float32 RGB images cropped and pansharpened from the DFC2019 raw data.
- **JSON dir:** `SatNeRF/root_dir/crops_rpcs_ba_v2` -> Contains the satellite images metadata (geographic location, RPC models, sun position).
- **GT dir:** `Datasets/DFC2019/Track3-Truth` -> Contains digital surface models (DSM) and segmentation masks (CLS) from the DFC2019 data.

### (3) IARPA set

- **Image dir:** `SatNeRF_IARPA/crops` -> Contains float32 RGB images cropped and pansharpened from the IARPA 2016 raw data.
- **JSON dir:** `SatNeRF_IARPA/root_dir/rpcs_ba` -> Contains the satellite images metadata (geographic location, RPC models, sun position).
- **GT dir:** `SatNeRF_IARPA/Truth` -> Contains digital surface models (DSM) and segmentation masks (CLS) from the IARPA 2016 data.


### Additional comments:

Only the image and json directories are needed to train EO-NeRF. GT data is only used for evaluation.

2025 extension: Shadow segmentation masks generated with 
"S-EO: A Large-Scale Dataset for Geometry-Aware Shadow Detection in Remote Sensing Applications" (Masquil et al., 2025) are included for shadow supervision, which can help improve the output 3D geometry. The shadow segmentation masks can be found in `DFC2019/Shadows-pred_v2`and `SatNeRF_IARPA/Shadows-pred_v2`.
